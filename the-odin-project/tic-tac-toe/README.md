This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript) curriculum. The goal was to create a tic-tac-toe game using Javascript, while using as little global code as possible. It was my first time practicing use of any JS design patterns, and I chose to keep it pretty Spartan.

As it stands, the code in index.js is wrapped in a function which I would like to break up into smaller pieces using object literal syntax.

### To Be Improved

* No Scoreboard or name customization
* After a game is won, a user may still click on an available space due to the click event listener being attached
